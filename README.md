# aws-web-fed-project
This project is a web federation application using serverless AWS services like S3 for static hosting, CloudFront for content delivery, and AWS Cognito with Google as the IdP for user authentication. 
I'm doing this project to gain hands-on experience with AWS web federation and serverless architecture. This project was done with the text guidance of Adrian Cantrill.
